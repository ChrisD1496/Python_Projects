# Python_Projects

Welcome to the Python_Projects repository! This collection contains various Python projects covering different domains and applications.

## Chapter 1: Classification Python Script

### Overview

The "Classification Python Script" is part of the Python_Projects repository, focusing on building and evaluating classification models. The script utilizes popular machine learning algorithms and techniques to perform classification tasks on a given dataset.

### Code Explanation

The Python script consists of a `Classification` class with methods for exploratory data analysis, distribution plots, and various classification algorithms such as Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The script starts with a comprehensive EDA, displaying the first few rows, statistical summary, correlation matrix, pair plots, and distribution plots of the dataset.

- **Distribution Plots:** The `plot_distributions` method generates distribution plots for each column in the dataset, providing insights into the data's characteristics.

- **Classification Algorithms:** The script includes methods for various classification algorithms, such as Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Network. Each method performs grid search for hyperparameter tuning and returns evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

### Requirements

Make sure to install the necessary libraries before running the script. You can install them using the following:

## Chapter 2: Regression Python Script

### Overview

The "Regression Python Script" is part of the Python_Projects repository, dedicated to performing regression analysis using different models and techniques.

## Chapter 3: SpringMassSystem

### Overview

The "SpringMassSystem" folder contains Python scripts related to simulating a Spring-Mass System. The simulation is divided into three main scripts:

1. **SpringMassSystem.py**: This script defines the physical description of the Spring-Mass System, primarily the differential equation representing the system.

2. **Solver.py**: The `Solver.py` script includes different solvers to numerically solve the differential equation of the Spring-Mass System. It implements solvers like Euler and Runge-Kutta.

3. **GUI.py**: The `GUI.py` script constructs a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Spring-Mass System simulation. This is the main script that needs to be executed to visualize and interact with the simulation. It utilizes PyQt5 for GUI components and integrates the functionality provided by `SpringMassSystem.py` and `Solver.py`.

### Running the GUI

To run the simulation, execute the `GUI.py` script. The GUI provides options to configure the Spring-Mass System model, solver settings, and view charts.

Interact with the GUI to configure the Spring-Mass System and observe the simulation results.
Feel free to explore and modify the scripts based on your simulation requirements. The GUI offers a user-friendly interface to experiment with different Spring-Mass System configurations and solvers.

For any additional information or questions, please refer to the documentation or contact the repository owner.
